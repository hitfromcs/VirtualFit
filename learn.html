      <h2>What is Virtual Fit?</h2>
      <p>Virtual Fit is an innovative e-commerce solution that allows users to try on clothes virtually using 3D models tailored to their body metrics. It brings personalization and accuracy to online shopping like never before.</p>

      <h2>Why Virtual Fit Matters</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges in fashion e-commerce is the high rate of returns due to size, color, or fit issues. Virtual Fit reduces return rates significantly by letting customers visualize clothing on a model that matches their body shape, size, and skin tone—leading to better purchase confidence.</p>

      <h2>Technological Innovation</h2>
      <p>This platform integrates PHP-based backend logic, user data processing (like height, chest, waist, skin tone), and a 3D engine using Three.js to load `.glb` models dynamically. Our solution merges server-side intelligence with immersive frontend visuals.</p>

      <h2>Best Color Contrast Outfit Algorithm</h2>
      <p>Our system intelligently recommends the best contrasting outfit combinations for users. For example, selecting a white shirt will automatically pair with black pants, ensuring visual harmony and style. The logic adapts based on color psychology and fashion contrast principles.</p>
